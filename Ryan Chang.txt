Ryan’s Form Design of the database has four buttons of:
•	Get Total Population
•	Get Average Population
•	Get Highest Population
•	Get Minimum Population
There is no “ascending order”, “descending order" or "Exit” button. The title text of the assignment should be “Population Database” instead of “Lab 2”. 
The file name was partially met titling, “Ryan-Chang-Lab-2-CPT-206”; which I greatly appreciated the separation title program assignments. 
However, it should have been titled, “RChang-Lab-2” like the course addendum showed at the very last page when submitting the assignment [highlighted in yellow].

The code, inside the Form Design, is short and neat. There are no comments to show what each button do for the program and they all show a message box for each 
button.

Upon running the program, a Microsoft Visual Studio message appeared and said,
	“There were build errors. Would you like to continue and run the last successful build?”
with a “Yes” or “No” option. I clicked on the “No” option because I didn’t want to risk my computer to crash. Thus, leading me back to the code and ending the program.

Overall, the program assignment is considered half complete and not complete. The “half complete” assignment shows the design form, code, and the 'mdf' file 
and the other half of “not complete” is not having the program run correctly without no error message and no comments within the code. Additionally, there is no form 
of the mdf file to pull up the database and details about the city and population.
